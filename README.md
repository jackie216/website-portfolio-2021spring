For my preview as of March 30th, I have the contents of the homepage titled "index.html" set up and the MOVIES category page which can be accessed by clicking the third icon on the homepage which is the solid black movie slate. You can get back to the homepage with the "back to main" link towards the top. I will probably end up condensing some of the categories so I'm not making a million separate htmls but this is the general layout I'm planning for. The background colors and borders are just there right now so I can see how the elements are being laid out right now. The images are also all not final at all.
