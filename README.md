My site consists of a homepage labeled index.html and nine categorical pages that can be accessed through the homepage. Only the first categorical page (the movie category named Movies-Page-Grid.html) is thoroughly completed (accessed by clicking the movie slate image) but the structure and layout of each of the nine category pages will be identical save for the content of the text and images. All nine category pages share a css file; the index page has its own separate css file named index-styles.css. Also, ALL images are currently either unfinished or place-holders, but they have been styled and positioned as I intend for the final product - it's just a matter of finalizing the actual images themselves.
