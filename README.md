My site is called Small Things because it is a compilation of rather insignificant things that have made me happy throughout quarantine. Nothing here is grand and everything is relatively accessible or doable. From the index page, you can select from a variety of categories by clicking on one of the nine icons. This will take you to a page where "small things" from that category will be listed; these can be navigated using the bar on the left side. Enjoy!
