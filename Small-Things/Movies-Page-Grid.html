              <p>Edward Scissorhands is a Tim Burton film starring Johnny Depp and Winona Rider. Although images and posters you may have seen might make it seem like a horror movie, I can assure you that it is not. It is a charmingly peculiar fairytale set in suburbia.</p>
              <p>The link to the trailer is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBHIO60whNw">here</a> though I think it ruins the film.</p>

              <p>Fly Away Home is a movie about a young girl who goes to live with her estranged father and ends up raising a flock of geese. It is one of my childhood favorites and has some really beautiful nature imagery and a very nice original sountrack. Though it starts a bit sad, by the end of the film, I always have a smile on my face. It is a very heart-warming film perfect if you want an interesting and beautiful movie for a quiet night in.</p>

              <p>Rush Hour is a 1998 action comedy starring Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker as a cop duo. Fair warning, the movie, while released in 1998, feels very VERY 2000's. I personally think Jackie Chan can do no wrong and Chris Tucker is always funny so if you're looking for some simple laughs, maybe give this a watch!

              <p>Orphan Black is a TV show about clones. It stars Tatiana Maslany as several different characters (spoilers: she's the clone). If you're looking for a suspense sci-fi-light drama with complex female characters, I cannot recommend this enough. It is 5 seasons long, 10 episodes per season, 40 minutes each.</p>

              <p>Keanu Reeves plays a man named John Wick, a retired assassin who gets forced back into the underground kill-for-hire world. If you like cool world building, gun-fu, and amazing fight choreography, this is what you want. I'm always surprised by the number of people who have never heard of this movie (now a trilogy series) and everyone who I've shown it to has enjoyed it immensely.</p>

              <p>I'm not a fan of musicals at all really but I've rewatched The Greatest Showman several times and I actually bought the soundtrack. With actual money. The movie is a fun story despite the unfortunate real-life persona of the titula character. Also, it stars Wolverine, Troy Bolton, and freaking Zendaya so that's a win.</p>

              <p>Chef is a story about a chef (shocker I know). Jon Favreau stars in it and also directed it. the first 30 minutes are some high-quality food and cooking inspo, which, if you're anything like me, is awesome. And, if you're a fan of the marvel universe, there are some specific castings choices that are pretty funny. It doesn't take itself too seriously and I've officially accepted this movie as MCU canon.</p>
