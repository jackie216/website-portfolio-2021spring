              <p>Edward Scissorhands is a Tim Burton film starring Johnny Depp and Winona Rider. Although images and posters you may have seen might make it seem like a horror movie, I can assure you that it is not. It is a charmingly peculiar fairytale set in suburbia.</p>

              <p>Fly Away Home is a movie about a young girl who goes to live with her estranged father and ends up raising a flock of geese. It is one of my childhood favorites and has some really beautiful nature imagery and a very nice original sountrack. Though it starts a bit sad, by the end of the film, I always have a smile on my face. It is a very heart-warming film perfect if you want an interesting and beautiful movie for a quiet night in.</p>
