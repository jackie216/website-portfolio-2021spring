          <div class='blurb'>My name is Jackie and I am a student at the University of Pittsburgh. This site is for a class called Composing Digital Media and this is the first time ever working with html and css. Like the blurb on the homepage said, this site is just a compilation of things that have made me happy. I hope that something you find here can also make you happy :)</div>
