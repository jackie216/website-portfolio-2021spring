              <p>I don't know what it's called (neither in English nor Korean); I only know that it's good and that my mom made it for me when I visited home to get my covid vaccine, and the only thing I can compare it to is a poke bowl. This has sesame sprouts, cucumber, lettuce, raw frozen tuna (cubed), and warm white sticky rice with a gochujang (Korean red chili paste) and vinegar dressing.</p>

              <p>These are my favorite treats to bake and we've had our family recipe for 20 years now. Eating them makes me very happy and no, I will not be giving out that recipe here but there are lots of recipes out on the internet! Have fun!</p>
