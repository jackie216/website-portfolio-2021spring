              <p>This book was recommended to me and I've read it a few times since last spring. It's nonfiction, and it's funny and there's some really good stuff about the AAPI experience.</p>

              <p>As you might guess by the title, this is a super interesting book about neurological conditions that manifest in some very strange perceptions and behaviors. As a neuro major, it's super interesting but you definitely don't need to know anything about neuroscience or neurology to read it.</p>

              <p>This is a collection of short stories. The movie Arrival (starring Amy Adams) was based off a short sotry by this author. Cool stuff.</p>

              <p>This is sold out everywhere around Christmas last year. It's technically a picture book but it has a very nice message and the illustration is beautiful. I gifted it to several people last Christmas when everyone needed a pick-me-up.</p>

              <p>Fun read and the premise is a pandemic which is ironic.</p>

              <p>This was my favorite book growing up and it's not as cheesy as you might think. Or maybe it is.</p>
