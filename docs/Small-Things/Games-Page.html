              <p>This is a card game one of my roommates introduced to me. It's a card game that is not so simple that it's boring but it's also not complicated - one round and you get the gist. Each card has certain powers that are explicitly written out at the bottom of each card and you play to beat other players' hands. And the cards are super cute which makes the whole thing feel cute and that's enough for me to like it. 10/10 would recommend. </p>
